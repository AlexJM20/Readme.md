# Princess  Warrior Sophia

A cause that is near and dear to my heart is, the battle for pedatric cancer awareness.

My 5 year old daughter Sophia is currently battling Pre-Cursor B-Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia.

She is being treated at one of the best hospitals in the country right here in our home town KC Metro, Childrens Mercy Hospital.

Here are some links below if you would like to raise awareness or donate, thanks!
