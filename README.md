## Hello! My name is Alex Maggard.

I am a new IT professional, looking to get my foot in the door to start my IT career.

While spending the past fifteen years in the restaurant industry and working my way up to an executive chef position, I have gained a great deal of customer service experience and skills during my time in the restaurant industry that I know will easily transfer to the skills needed to be excel in an IT support role.
