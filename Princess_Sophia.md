# Princess  Warrior Sophia

A cause that is near and dear to my heart is, the battle for pedatric cancer awareness.

My 5 year old daughter Sophia is currently battling *Pre-Cursor B-Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia*.

She is being treated at one of the best hospitals in the country right here in our home town KC Metro, Childrens Mercy Hospital.
